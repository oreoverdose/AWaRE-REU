## aria_controller
Attempt at making middle-man between ROS and Aria (rosaria). Was a bit slower (0.2s) at publishing to cmd_vel than rosaria. Not sure why. Ended up using rosaria instead for testing the feedback controller in the real robot.

## itmp_gazebo_simulation
Tests the controller in gazebo. Builds foundation for rosaria controller. Implements camera too.
